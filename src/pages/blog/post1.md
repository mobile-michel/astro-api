# Hello world!

**Everything** supported in a `.md` file is also supported here!

There is _zero_ runtime overhead.

In addition, Astro supports:
- Astro expressions
- Automatic indentation normalization
- Automatic escaping of expressions inside code blocks


```js
  // This content is not transformed!
  const object = { someOtherValue };
```

- Rich component support like any `.astro` file!
- Recursive Markdown support (Component children are also processed as Markdown)
