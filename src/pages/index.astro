			## Project Structure

			Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

			```
			/
			├── public/
			│   └── favicon.ico
			├── src/
			│   ├── components/
			│   │   └── Head.astro
			│   ├── layouts/
			│   │   └── BlogLayout.astro
			│   │   └── PageLayout.astro
			│   ├── pages/
			│   │   └── index.astro
			│   └── styles/
			│       └── global.css
			└── package.json
			```

			Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory.
			Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

			There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

			Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
